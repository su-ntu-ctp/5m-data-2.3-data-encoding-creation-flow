# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation

- Ensure you have a basic understanding of XML and REST API as listed in [studies](./studies.md).

- We will be using the `bde` environment for this lesson. You do not need to create the environment again if you have previously created one. If you do not have the `bde` environment, please refer to [the environment folder](https://github.com/su-ntu-ctp/5m-data-2.1-intro-big-data-eng/tree/main/environments) and the [setup instructions](https://github.com/su-ntu-ctp/5m-data-2.1-intro-big-data-eng/blob/main/installation.md) to create a new one if you have not done so previously.

<!-- We will be using the following notebooks `notebooks/encoding_flow_lesson.ipynb` notebook throughout this lesson. -->
We will be using the following notebooks for each section in this lesson:

1. Apache Thrift - [`demo_thrift.ipynb`](notebooks/demo_thrift.ipynb)
2. Protocol Buffers (Protobufs) - [`demo_protobuf.ipynb`](notebooks/demo_protobuf.ipynb)
3. Apache Avro - [`demo_avro.ipynb`](notebooks/demo_avro.ipynb)
4. Apache Parquet, ORC and Arrow - [`demo_parquet_orc_arrow.ipynb`](notebooks/demo_parquet_orc_arrow.ipynb)

Open the notebook in VSCode by double clicking on the file. Then select `bde` conda environment for the kernel.
